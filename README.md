# Daily Coding Problems

I subscribe to a daily coding problem email list. I'm using the problems as a means to practice using Rust, but I don't anticipate keeping up with them daily.

Each crate is structured as a submodule. To pull each submodule, run git submodule update --init --recursive after cloning.
