# Daily Coding Problems

I subscribe to a daily coding problem email list. I'm using the problems as a means to practice using Rust. Each crate is structured as a submodule. To pull each submodule, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning.

Don't let the title fool you: I don't suspect I'll have time to do these daily.
